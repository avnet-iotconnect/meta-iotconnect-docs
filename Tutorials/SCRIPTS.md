# IoTConnect Script Deployment for Cloud-to-Device Messages
This document outlines how IoTConnect enables the deployment of cloud-to-device messages across various IoTConnect SDK implementations. These messages typically trigger the execution of scripts on the device for various tasks such as system monitoring, software updates, or AI classification.

## Overview
IoTConnect supports sending commands from the cloud to devices that can trigger the execution of scripts. This allows for flexible, remote control of devices using any IoTConnect SDK.

## Key Components
IoTConnect Platform: Sends cloud-to-device commands.
Device: Receives commands and executes specified scripts.
Script Management: Scripts are pre-installed on the device and triggered based on cloud commands.
Steps for Script Deployment
1. Create Cloud Commands
In the IoTConnect platform, you can define commands that will be sent to the device. Each command should include details about which script to run on the device.

Example Command Payload:
```
{
  "command": "run_script",
  "script": "/path/to/script.sh"
}
```
2. Deploy Commands to Devices
Once a command is created, assign it to the device(s). The devices will listen for commands from IoTConnect and execute the script as instructed.

3. Command Handling on the Device
The device needs to be configured to listen for commands and execute the appropriate scripts. This is often done through an event-driven architecture, where a handler executes the script when a command is received.

Example Python Command Handler:
```
import subprocess
from iotconnect import IoTConnectSDK

iotc = IoTConnectSDK(device_id="DEVICE_ID", client_key="CLIENT_KEY")

def on_command_received(command):
    script_path = command.get('script')
    if script_path:
        subprocess.run(script_path, shell=True)

iotc.on_command_received = on_command_received
iotc.connect()
``` 
4. Script Execution
Once the device receives the command, it uses the provided path to locate and execute the script. The script could perform various tasks like restarting a service, running diagnostics, or performing AI-based tasks.

## Benefits of Cloud-to-Device Scripting
- Remote Control: Trigger any action on the device from the cloud.
- Scalability: Deploy commands to a fleet of devices.
- Flexibility: Scripts can perform any action that the device is capable of.
## Troubleshooting
- Command Not Received: Ensure the device is connected and properly configured with its credentials.
- Script Permission Issues: Make sure the scripts are executable by running chmod +x /path/to/script.sh.
- Script Not Found: Verify that the script path in the command payload matches the actual script location on the device.
