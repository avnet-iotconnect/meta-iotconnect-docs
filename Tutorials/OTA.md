# OTA Update Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to create and install an Over-The-Air (OTA) update using the provided folder structure and `install.sh` script. The OTA process ensures that the device’s application and local data are updated safely and reliably.

## OTA Payload Folder Structure

The OTA payload consists of a specific folder structure, which is cosmpressed into a `.tar.gz` file and uploaded to the device. The folder structure is as follows:
```
ota-payload-template/
├── install.sh
├── application
   ├── model
   └── scripts
├── local_data
│   └── certs
└── README
```
## Key Components:

- **`install.sh`**: The script responsible for installing the OTA update on the device.
- **`application/`**: This folder contains new or updated application files. These will be installed in `/usr/iotc/bin/iotc-python-sdk`.
- **`local_data/`**: This folder contains local data such as configuration files or certificates. These will be installed in `/usr/iotc/local`.

## OTA Example Payload

An example payload might look like this:

ota-payload-template/ ├── application │ ├── model │ ├── scripts │ │ └── get_mem_usage.sh │ └── telemetry_demo.py ├── install.sh ├── local_data │ ├── certs │ │ └── device.key │ └── config.json └── README

Copy code

### This payload would:

- Update `application/telemetry_demo.py`, replacing the current Python file.
- Add a new script `get_mem_usage.sh` to the device.
- Update the local configuration (`local_data/config.json`) and certificate (`local_data/certs/device.key`).

## Creating the OTA Payload

### Modify the template:

- Place your new or updated files into the appropriate directories (`application/` or `local_data/`).

### Construct the payload:

- Navigate to the root of the folder and run:

```bash
./construct_payload.sh
```
This will create a ota-payload.tar.gz file, which is ready to be uploaded to the device.

### install.sh Script Explanation
The install.sh script is responsible for handling the installation of the OTA update. Below is a breakdown of its key components:

1. Defining Directories
SCRIPT_DIR: The directory where the script is located.
Payload Directories:
application_payload_dir: New application files from the OTA payload.
local_data_payload_dir: New local data files from the OTA payload.
Installed Directories:
application_installed_dir: Current application files on the device.
local_data_installed_dir: Current local data on the device.
Backup Directories:
application_backup_dir: Backup location for the current application files.
local_data_backup_dir: Backup location for the current local data files.
2. Backup Process
The script creates backups of the current installed files before applying the OTA update:

If a backup directory already exists, it is removed:
bash
Copy code
if [ -d "$backup_dir" ]; then
    echo "Removing existing backup... at $backup_dir"
    rm -r "$backup_dir"
fi
It then creates a fresh backup:
bash
Copy code
mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
cp -va "$installed_dir". "$backup_dir"
3. Modify Paths in Backups
After creating the backup, the script updates any paths in configuration files to point to the new backup directory:

bash
Copy code
find "$backup_dir" -type f -print | while read -r file; do
    sed -i "s|$installed_dir|$backup_dir|g" "$file"
done
4. Installing the OTA Payload
The OTA payload is installed by copying the new application and data files from the OTA payload to the corresponding directories on the device:

bash
Copy code
cp -va $payload_dir. $to_install_dir
5. Completion Check
The script checks if the installation was successful:

bash
Copy code
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "install.sh completed successfully."
else
    >&2 echo "install.sh encountered errors."
    exit 1
fi
If the installation fails, an error message is printed, and the script exits with an error status.

Step-by-Step OTA Installation
Backup Process:

The script backs up the current application and local data directories, ensuring there is a fallback if the OTA update fails.
Modify Backup Configurations:

The paths in the backed-up configuration files are updated to reflect the new backup directory.
Install the OTA Payload:

The payload is installed by copying the new files to the correct directories on the device.
Check for Errors:

The script checks if the installation was successful. If not, it outputs an error and stops the process.
Error Handling and Rollback
The script is designed to safely back up the current application and data files. In the event of an OTA failure, the backup can be used for rollback.

Consider adding a rollback mechanism to automatically restore the backup in case the OTA update fails.
Optional Enhancements
Rollback Mechanism: Implement a separate script to restore the backed-up files in case the update needs to be rolled back.
Payload Verification: Add checksum or hash verification to ensure that the OTA payload is not corrupted before installation.
Conclusion
This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to creating, installing, and managing OTA updates using the provided install.sh script. The script ensures safety through backups and error handling while updating the application and local data files on the device.
