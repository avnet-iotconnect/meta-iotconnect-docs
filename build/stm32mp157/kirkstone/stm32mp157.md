## Build Instructions

These instructions are designed to get a Yocto image up and running for a specific board, these are simplified to get you to a similar point on each board and then you return to the main instructions of adding the IOTConnect layers to your build.

These instructions leverage the power of Docker to create a reproducible build that works across different OS environments, one of the main ideas is to avoid problems caused by having a too old/new version of Linux being used the Yocto build system, as those can cause build failures.

Provided in the folder are both the `Dockerfile` and `Makefile` to simplify the build process.

Tested on Ubuntu 22.04, 23.10

# Requirements
- Repo tool (from Google) - https://android.googlesource.com/tools/repo
- Docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ + https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user
- git name and email added to global scope
- STM32_Programmer_CLI - similar steps to [this](https://wiki.somlabs.com/index.php/Installing_STM32CubeProgrammer_on_Ubuntu_18.04) but use the latest release

# Method
1. Create a work directory, for example ~/work
    ```bash
    cd ~/work
    ```

2. Create project directory and enter it
    ```bash
    mkdir iotconnect-stm32mp17-kirkstone && cd iotconnect-stm32mp17-kirkstone
    ```

3. Use repo tool to get the yocto sources
    ```bash
    repo init -u https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/oe-manifest.git -b refs/tags/openstlinux-5.15-yocto-kirkstone-mp1-v23.07.26 && repo sync    
    ```

4.  wget provided Makefile and Dockerfile to project directory and execute these commands in the terminal
    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-yocto-python-sdk/kirkstone/board_specific_readmes/stm32mp157/Makefile && \
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-yocto-python-sdk/kirkstone/board_specific_readmes/stm32mp157/Dockerfile
    make docker
    
    DISTRO=openstlinux-weston MACHINE=stm32mp1 source layers/meta-st/scripts/envsetup.sh
    # go through all of the EULA and accept everything
    
    exit
    
    make build
    # this will take a while as this is the initial build.
    ```

### Extras

1. To flash
    ```bash
    make flash
    ```
