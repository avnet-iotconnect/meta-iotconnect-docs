  - `local_data_payload_dir`: Contains the new local data files from the OTA payload.
- **Installed Directories**:
  - `application_installed_dir`: Current application files on the device.
  - `local_data_installed_dir`: Current local data on the device.
- **Backup Directories**:
  - `application_backup_dir`: Backup location for the current application files.
  - `local_data_backup_dir`: Backup location for the current local data files.

#### 8.5.2: Backup Process

Before applying the update, the script backs up the current files:

```bash
if [ -d "$backup_dir" ]; then
    echo "Removing existing backup at $backup_dir"
    rm -r "$backup_dir"
fi
```
### 8.5.3: Modify Paths in Backups
The script updates any paths in configuration files to point to the new backup directory:
```
find "$backup_dir" -type f -print | while read -r file; do
sed -i "s|$installed_dir|$backup_dir|g" "$file"
done
```
