# 7. Cloud Account Setup
An IoTConnect account with AWS backend is required.  If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is available.

[IoTConnect Free Trial (AWS Version)](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws)

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

See the IoTConnect [Subscription Information](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/subscription.md) for more details on the trial.

# 8. IoTConnect Device Template Setup
A Device Template define the type of telemetery the platform should expect to recieve.
* Download the premade device template [device_template_stm32mp2ai.JSON](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/meta-iotconnect-docs/blob/main/QuickStart/ST/STM32MP257/demo-iotc-x-linux-ai/templates/device_template_stm32mp2ai.JSON?raw=1) (**MUST** Right-Click and "Save-As" to get the raw json file)
* Import the template into your IoTConnect instance. (A guide on [Importing a Device Template](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/import_device_template.md) is available or for more information, please see the [IoTConnect Documentation](https://docs.iotconnect.io/iotconnect/) website.)

# 9. Create a Device in IoTConnect

1. **Click** the Device icon and the "Device" sub-menu
2. At the top-right, click on the "Create Device" button
3. Enter "STM32MP257" for both **Unique ID** and **Device Name**
4. Select the entity in the drop-down (if this is a new/trial account, there is only one option)
5. Select the template ("stm32mp257 AI Demo") from the template dropdown box
6. Leave the Device Certificate as "Auto-generated"
7. Click Save & View
8. Click the "Download device configuration" icon at the top-right ans save it to your working

## 6. Running the Initial Device Setup Script

The `initial-device.sh` script automates much of the setup, including configuring `config.json`, transferring files, and setting up certificates.

### 6.1 Initial Device Script Overview
The script organizes files into specific directories on the device, including:

- **Configuration Files**
  - `config.json`: Configures device-specific details like CPID, DUID, environment, and server certificate paths.
  - `Certs/`: Contains device certificates for secure connection.

- **Application and AI Demo Scripts**: IoTConnect Python SDK and support scripts.
  - `iotc-python-sdk`: Core SDK for IoTConnect interaction.
  - `iotc-python-demo.py`: Example script to demonstrate data exchange.
  - `x-linux-ai`: AI demo scripts and model data.
    - `image-classification`: Scripts for launching MobileNetV2 model for image classification.
    - `object-detection`: Scripts for object detection using pre-trained models.
    - `pose-estimation`: Scripts for human pose estimation.
    - `semantic-segmentation`: Scripts for semantic segmentation tasks.

- **Local Data Files**
  - `local_data`: Stores runtime data and command information.
  - `data/classification`: Stores classification results.
    - `confidence`: Records model confidence scores.
    - `running-model`: Tracks the active AI model.
    - `set-conf-level`: Configures confidence thresholds.
    - `version`: Holds version information.
  - `scripts`: Command scripts to control and monitor device functions, such as starting/stopping models, controlling LEDs, and checking memory usage.

### 6.2 Running the Script

1. **Download or Transfer the `initial-device.sh` Script**: Place the script in your working directory.
2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./initial-device.sh
3. **Follow the Prompts**: The script will prompt you for details like the target IP address, paths to `iotcDeviceConfig.json`, and the certificate zip file.
   - The script will automatically:
     - Configure device-specific settings in `config.json`.
     - Transfer necessary files (application data, local data, AI models) to the target directories on the device.
     - Run the installation script remotely on the device to finalize setup.
4. **Script Completion**: After completion, your device should be fully configured and ready for IoTConnect. If any issues arise, the script provides feedback to help with troubleshooting.
